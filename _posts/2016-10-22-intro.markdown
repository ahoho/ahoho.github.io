# Alternate Realities: Analyzing Partisan Media Sources

## An Introduction to the Problem
Within the American political intelligentsia, it's become [well-established](http://prospect.org/article/hardened-divide-american-politics-0) that the electorate has increasingly polarized in the past two decades. Despite the endless effluent of horse-race polling and clickbait punditry, 2016 has proved to be a [remarkably stable race](http://election.princeton.edu/2016/10/10/some-secrets-are-not-all-that- dirty/) as exhibited by limited variance in public opinion[^1]. On the whole, voters have coalesced around their respective party's candidates, indicating a severe entrenchment[^2].

Resulting from this world order are a shared suspicion and attendant rhetoric on the part of political thinkers that each side sources facts from its own isolated spring. In both debates, Clinton has accused Trump of living in an ['alternate reality'.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate- transcript-229519).

A truism often touted by those remarking on this entrenchment is that these divisions are ignited and reignited by a hyper-fragmented topography in our political media. It goes: we prefer to seek out news sources that confirm our predispositions, reject the ones that do not, dig in our heels when we hear conflicting evidence, and get our news from online echo chambers maintain and exacerbate the cycle[^3]. This [is](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/24/486941582/the-reason-your-feed-became-an-echo-chamber-and-what-to-do-about-it) [familiar](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.c129e751ebc2) [territory](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/the-echo-chamber-effect).

Anachronisms aside -- the polarized era began 10 years before Facebook launched[^4] -- there does seem to be, at least on a gut level, some meat in these claims.

A recent [NY **Times** article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/magazine/inside-facebooks-totally-insane-unintentionally-gigantic-hyperpartisan-political-media-machine.html?_r=0) provides a well-articulated account of the dynamic. To summarize, in response to these patterns of consumption, a growing number of openly partisan media sources have cropped up. Engineered to optimize Facebook's modes of dissemination, their collective audience is massive. They exert a significant influence on the American political conversation.

We can see this process in effect in the 2016 election cycle in particular, which has indulged the fringe element to an extreme degree. Trump is the conspiracy theory candidate: from his racist birtherism, to persistent insistence on a rigged election, he has vindicated the intimate faiths of the frothy nuclear-bunker crowd. To be sure, there's also a contingent on the left that insists on rampant voter fraud in the Dem. primaries and has decoupled the irony from the tongue-in-cheek comments about Trump's "cocaine sniffles"[^5].

## An Analysis of the Problem

So, to what extent does the bifurcated media contribute to and mirror these correspondingly divergent realities? 

To me, lacking from the discourse delineated above is a comprehensive account of the **content** of these sources. *What are the rhetorics, vocabularies, and topics found in partisan media, and how do they vary by political alignment?*

To answer this question, I'll collect articles originating from a set of partisan outlets and analyze their text content using different natural language processing models.

My motivation for this analysis results, in part, from [a 2015 paper](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1160) by Eytan Bakshy, Solomon Messing, and Lada Adamic, which describes the processes by which "social networks influence exposure to perspectives that cut accross ideological lines." In an interactive feature, ["Blue Feed, Red Feed"](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/), **The Wall Street Journal** illustrates their research. I use the [sources underlying that project](https://github.com/jonkeegan/blue-feed-red-feed-sources) as the starting point for creating my dataset.

In addition, I was particularly fascinated by [a 2015 blog post](http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-30-rejecting-the-gender-binary.html) by Ben Shmidt at Northeastern University that uses word embedding (in particular, Thomas Mikolov's Word2vec models) to examine gendered language in student reviews of professors.

Although at this stage I'm not yet sure of the precise set of analyses I'll undertake, I anticipate that the size and quality of the data will allow for varied approaches.

*Next up: creating the dataset*.

[^1]: This year, the national Clinton vs. Trump margin has had a [standard deviation of under 2.2 percentage points.](http://election.princeton.edu/2016/09/16/is-a-change-in-the-air/). Credit to [Sam Wang](http://election.princeton.edu) for the arguments in this paragraph.

[^2]: That said, [historically high levels](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-clinton-edge-gets- even-narrower/) of undecideds and third-party voters do point to a certain, uh, **distaste** for these choices.

[^3]: I note that in the case of blaming Facebook's News Feed, [the criticism is somewhat misguided.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/05/06/science.aaa1160.abstract) In brief, it's a PEBKAC problem, in that users click on links that confirm biases despite having access to opposing views.

[^4]: See the above (**American Prospect** article)[http://prospect.org/article/hardened-divide-american-politics-0]. Although I have even seen it suggested that the [stark drop-off in cross-party voting in '96](http://prospect.org/article/hardened-divide-american-politics-0) is connected in in some psychic way to the contemporaneous launch of Fox News.

[^5]: Of course, Trump has indulged and fanned these fictions to an unprecedented and dangerous extent.

[^6]: While it arguably began on November 6, 2012, I'm starting in June 2015, when Trump declared his candidacy. Should this provide dataset of insufficient size, I may expand the scope.
