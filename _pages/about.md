I am a second-year PhD student working at the University of Maryland's [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) lab, where I am advised by [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/). My research interests involve using interpretable unsupervised methods to study social and cultural phenomena as manifested in language.

Previously, I completed my master's in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London, where my thesis advisors were [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org) and [Jeff Mitchell](http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/jeffrey-j-mitchell/overview.html) at the [UCL NLP](https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) group. Before my return to academia, I was a Research Analyst at The Brattle Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I built econometric models, developed a document retrieval platform, and did additional work that could be classified as data science. In a key project, I helped conduct research on New York City public housing for the U.S. Department of Justice; these efforts eventually led to a [$2.2 billion settlement](https://nypost.com/2018/06/11/city-settles-for-more-than-2b-with-nycha-over-horrendous-living-conditions/) to improve conditions.
