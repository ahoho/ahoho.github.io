I am a PhD student working at the University of Maryland's [Compuational Linguistics and Information Processing](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) lab, where I am advised by [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/).

[//]: # I'm broadly driven by a desire to study how language operates in culture. How does ideology manifest itself in language? How do groups use the same words differently (and how are groups described differently)? How do radical ideas propagate and take root? I think that to frame these questions correctly, we need to invoke hypotheses & theory from the social sciences. To answer them thoroughly, we need NLP. Hence, on the methological side, I'm interested in developing interpretable models[^1]. In particular, my current focus is on using inductive biases to structure the latent space of latent-variable models. TODO: See email to HC

Previously, I completed my master's in computational statistics and machine learning at Universtiy College London, where my thesis advisors were [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org) and [Jeff Mitchell](http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/jeffrey-j-mitchell/overview.html). Before my return to academia, I was an economic consultant at The Brattle Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I developed an internal document retrieval platform, built econometric models, and did a lot of work that could be broadly classified as data science (I remain an avid evangalist of R’s tidyverse over python’s pandas).

[//]: # For my master's thesis, I am working in the [UCL Machine Reading](http://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) group under [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org). Using Wikipedia data, I'm developing a model that can determine when a factual claim requires an external citation for support. What makes this interesting is that it requires identifying the "beats" that constitute a given concept (e.g., although made up of several sentences, the following only requires a single citation: "[Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure) was born in Geneva in 1857. His father was Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure, a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen.")

[//]: # [^1]: Since the definition of "interpretable" varies, I mean it in the same way that linear regression is interpretable: it can express theory, states clear statistical assumptions, and has parameters that are meaningful in and of themselves.
