<h3 id="an-introduction-to-the-problem">An Introduction to the Problem</h3>

<p>Within the American political intelligentsia, it’s become <a href="http://prospect.org/article/hardened-divide-american-politics-0">well-established</a> that the electorate has increasingly polarized in the past two decades. Despite the endless effluent of horse-race polling and clickbait punditry, 2016 has proved to be a <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2016/10/10/some-secrets-are-not-all-that- dirty/">remarkably stable race</a> as exhibited by limited variance in public opinion<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. On the whole, voters have coalesced around their respective party’s candidates, indicating a severe entrenchment<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Resulting from this world order are a shared suspicion and attendant rhetoric on the part of political thinkers that each side sources facts from its own isolated spring. In both debates, Clinton has accused Trump of living in an <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate- transcript-229519">‘alternate reality’.</a>.</p>

<p>A truism often touted by those remarking on this entrenchment is that these divisions are ignited and reignited by a hyper-fragmented topography in our political media. It goes: we prefer to seek out news sources that confirm our predispositions, reject the ones that do not, dig in our heels when we hear conflicting evidence, and get our news from online echo chambers that maintain and exacerbate the cycle<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. The latter point being especially salient, since our ability to self-curate has been facilitated by social media, and the market has responded in kind. This <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/24/486941582/the-reason-your-feed-became-an-echo-chamber-and-what-to-do-about-it">is</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.c129e751ebc2">familiar</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/21/barack-obama-and-the-psychology-of-the-birther-myth/the-echo-chamber-effect">territory</a>.</p>

<p>Anachronisms aside – the polarized era began 10 years before Facebook launched<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> – there does seem to be, at least on a gut level, some meat in these claims.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/magazine/inside-facebooks-totally-insane-unintentionally-gigantic-hyperpartisan-political-media-machine.html?_r=0">NY <em>Times</em> article</a> provides a well-articulated account of the dynamic. The basic premise is that, in response to these patterns of consumption, a growing number of openly partisan media sources have cropped up. Engineered to optimize Facebook’s modes of dissemination, their collective audience is massive and they therefore exert a significant influence on the American political conversation.</p>

<p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1160">A 2015 Facebook study</a> by Eytan Bakshy, Solomon Messing, and Lada Adamic in <em>Science</em> concisely summarizes the researched problem as it stands today:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Although [social network technologies] have the potential to expose individuals to more diverse viewpoints, they also have the potential to limit exposure to attitude-challenging 	information, which is associated with the	adoption of more extreme attitudes over time and misperception of facts about current events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can see this process in effect in the 2016 election cycle in particular, which has indulged the fringe element to an extreme degree. Trump is the conspiracy theory candidate: from his racist birtherism, to persistent insistence on a rigged election, he has vindicated the intimate faiths of the frothy nuclear-bunker crowd. To be sure, there’s also a contingent on the left that insists on rampant voter fraud in the Dem. primaries and has decoupled the irony from the tongue-in-cheek comments about Trump’s “cocaine sniffles”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We’ve arrived at a moment where nonfactual beliefs are sufficiently widespread to affect national politics to a lurid degree. To my mind, this is a huge fucking problem.</p>

<h3 id="analyzing-the-problem">Analyzing the Problem</h3>

<p>As far as I’m aware, lacking from the discourse delineated above is a comprehensive account of the <em>content</em> of these sources. By comprehensive, I mean arguments that draw on more than a writer’s experience of, for instance, alt-right websites. Namely, ones that rely on extensive data<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. What are the rhetorics, vocabularies, and topics found across partisan media, and how do they vary by political alignment? To what extent does the bifurcated media contribute to and mirror these correspondingly divergent realities?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I’ve decided to collect articles originating from a set of partisan outlets and analyze their text content using different natural language processing models.</p>

<p>My motivation for this analysis results, in part, from the above-mentioned <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1160">Facebook study</a>, which describes the processes by which “social networks influence exposure to perspectives that cut across ideological lines.” In an interactive feature, <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/">“Blue Feed, Red Feed”</a>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> illustrates their research. I use the <a href="https://github.com/jonkeegan/blue-feed-red-feed-sources">sources underlying that project</a> as the starting point for creating my dataset.</p>

<p>In addition, I was particularly fascinated by <a href="http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-30-rejecting-the-gender-binary.html">a 2015 blog post</a> by Ben Shmidt at Northeastern University that uses word embedding (in particular, Thomas Mikolov’s Word2vec models) to examine gendered language in student reviews of professors.</p>

<p>Although at this stage I’m not yet sure of the precise set of analyses I’ll undertake, I anticipate that the size and quality of the data will allow for varied approaches.</p>

<p><em>Next up: creating the dataset</em>.</p>

      <p>This year, the national Clinton vs. Trump margin has had a <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2016/09/16/is-a-change-in-the-air/">standard deviation of under 2.2 percentage points.</a>.

      <p>That said, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-clinton-edge-gets- even-narrower/">historically high levels</a> of undecideds and third-party voters do point to a certain, uh, <em>distaste</em> for these choices. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I note that in the case of blaming Facebook’s News Feed, <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1160">the Bakshy, Messing, Adamic article shows the criticism to be somewhat misguided.</a> In brief, it’s a PEBKAC problem, in that users click on links that confirm biases despite having access to opposing views. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>See the above [<a href="http://prospect.org/article/hardened-divide-american-politics-0"><em>American Prospect</em> article</a>.
