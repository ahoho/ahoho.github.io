I am currently a master's student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at Universtiy College London. Before coming to London, I was an economic consultant at The Brattle Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I specialized in data science.

For my master's thesis, I am working in the [UCL Machine Reading](http://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) group under [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org). Using Wikipedia data, I'm developing a model that can determine when a factual claim requires an external citation for support. What makes this interesting is that it requires identifying the "beats" that constitute a given concept (e.g., although made up of several sentences, the following only requires a single citation: "[Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure) was born in Geneva in 1857. His father was Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure, a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen.")
