        I'm a fourth-year PhD student working at the University of Maryland's <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page">Computational Linguistics and Information Processing</a> lab, where I'm advised by <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/">Philip Resnik</a>.</p>
        
        <p>My research is oriented around the development and evaluation of methods for computational social science. My basic contention is that the field of NLP is well-served served by grounding it in the needs of social science&mdash;giving direction to concepts like interpretability and generalization. On the methods side, I'm interested in identifying latent constructs (perhaps call it "very abstractive summarization"): topic models, ideal points models, NLG for annotation. In terms of evaluation, I like to think about validity: are we really measuring what we want to measure? Topically, I'm drawn to work on bias &amp; fairness and political science.</p>

        <p>This past summer I was an intern in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate-montreal/">FATE group at Microsoft Research</a>. In the past I have interned with <a href="https://allenai.org/allennlp">AllenNLP at AI2</a>. Previously, I completed my master's in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London, where my thesis advisors were <a href="http://www.riedelcastro.org">Sebastian Riedel</a> and <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/jeffrey-j-mitchell/overview.html">Jeff Mitchell</a> at the <a href="https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL NLP</a> group.</p>
            
        <p>After undergrad, I was a Research Analyst at The Brattle Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I built econometric models, developed a document retrieval platform, and did additional work that could be classified as data science. In a key project, I helped conduct research on New York City public housing for the U.S. Department of Justice; these efforts eventually led to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/11/city-settles-for-more-than-2b-with-nycha-over-horrendous-living-conditions/">$2.2 billion settlement</a> to improve conditions.</p>
