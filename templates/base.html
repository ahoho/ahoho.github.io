        <p><img class="prof-pic" alt="Profile picture" src="assets/img/prof_pic.jpg">
        <p>I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://ai.ethz.ch/">ETH Zürich AI Center</a>, where I sit in both <a href="https://rycolab.io/">natural language processing/machine learning</a> and <a href="https://lawecon.ethz.ch/">social science groups.</a></p>
        
        <p>I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, where I was based in the <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page">Computational Linguistics and Information Processing</a> lab. My wonderful advisor was <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/">Philip Resnik</a>.</p>
        
        <p>My research is oriented around the development and evaluation of methods for computational social science. My basic contention is that the field of NLP is well-served served by grounding it in the needs of social science&mdash;giving direction to concepts like interpretability and generalization. On the methods side, I'm interested in identifying latent constructs (perhaps call it "very abstractive summarization"): topic models, ideal points models, NLG for annotation. In terms of evaluation, I like to think about validity: are we really measuring what we want to measure? Topically, I'm drawn to work on bias &amp; fairness and political science; more recently, I've started work on constructs in mental health, specifically those relating to suicidality. If this sounds at all interesting to you and you'd like to work together: please reach out!</p>

        <p>During the PhD, I interned with both the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate-montreal/">FATE group at Microsoft Research</a> and <a href="https://allenai.org/allennlp">AllenNLP at AI2</a>. Before the PhD, I completed my master's in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London, where my thesis advisors were <a href="http://www.riedelcastro.org">Sebastian Riedel</a> and <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/jeffrey-j-mitchell/overview.html">Jeff Mitchell</a> at the <a href="https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL NLP</a> group.</p>
            
        <p>After undergrad, I was a Research Analyst at The Brattle Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I built econometric models, developed a document retrieval platform, and did additional work that could be classified as data science. In my most interesting project, I helped conduct research on New York City public housing for the U.S. Department of Justice; these efforts eventually led to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/11/city-settles-for-more-than-2b-with-nycha-over-horrendous-living-conditions/">$2.2 billion settlement</a> to improve conditions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At UMD, I was involved in graduate labor advocacy and organizing. I chaired the Data and Research group of the Graduate Assistant Advisory Committee, and I testified on behalf of graduate assistants before the Maryland state legislature.</li>
            <li>I participate in Científico Latino's <a href="https://www.cientificolatino.com/gsmi">Graduate Student Mentorship Initiative</a>. Mentees have been accepted to the residency program at Meta AI and UCSD. If you are applying to schools, please contact me and I will be happy to read your materials!</li>
            <li>In my spare time, I like to read, run, cycle, cook, and talk.</li>
